# Setting up the workspace in your IDE

Step 1 : Open up your workspace drive such as `D:` , `E:`  or `F:`

Step 2 : Create your workspace folder with your project name. To coordinate us, I’m keeping my

               folder name as `my_react_portfolio`

Step 3 : Open the folder in VS Code and Open a Terminal.

Step 4 : Use `npm create vite@latest <your_project_name>`in my case project_name would be `my_Portfolio` to create a React Project. It will prompt some options and choose the below configurations for a basic setup.
```
E:\my_react_portfolio> npm create vite@latest my_Portfolio
Need to install the following packages:
create-vite@6.1.1
Ok to proceed? (y) y
√ Package name: ... my-portfolio
√ Select a framework: » React
√ Select a variant: » JavaScript

Scaffolding project in E:\my_react_portfolio\my_Portfolio...

Done. Now run:

  cd my_Portfolio
  npm install
  npm run dev


E:\my_react_portfolio>
```

After that, You will see set of files and folders created in your workspace, (make sure you are connected to the internet before all of this). 
```
E:\my_react_portfolio>cd my_Portfolio

E:\my_react_portfolio\my_Portfolio>npm install

  VITE v6.0.7  ready in 271 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help

```

So, your application is now running in port 5173 by default, but you can always change that to any required port (I usually prefer 3000 when doing frontend stuff)

To change your default port, head over to `vite.config.js` 

and you’ll see something like this.

```
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
})
```
and if you already started running your server, you may see something like this..

```
6:39:21 pm [vite] vite.config.js changed, restarting server...
6:39:21 pm [vite] vite.config.js changed, restarting server... (x2)
6:39:21 pm [vite] server restarted.
```

Great, with everything set correctly, you can see something like the below one in your browser at port 5173 / 3000 (depends on what you configured).

![]()

Great, Now, you got our project setup up and running in your machine. Let’s take a step back and understand the folder structure of the project in the next module :)
